  <h1>Nourishing During Your Cycle: How Protein Helps</h1>
  <p>Your menstrual cycle influences energy levels, cravings and nutrient needs. During the luteal phase (the week before your period), estrogen and progesterone fluctuate, often leading to increased appetite and decreased serotonin. Protein‑rich foods can stabilize blood sugar and support mood.</p>
<p>Choose snacks with protein and complex carbohydrates such as hummus with whole‑grain crackers, yogurt with fruit or a small Koia shake. These options provide tryptophan, an amino acid that supports serotonin production, and help keep cravings in check.</p>
<p>Staying hydrated and prioritizing sleep also support hormonal balance. Listen to your body and adjust your nutrition accordingly throughout your cycle.</p>
