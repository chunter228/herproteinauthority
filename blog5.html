  <h1>High‑Protein Breakfast Ideas to Power Your Day</h1>
  <p>Breakfast sets the tone for the day. Starting with protein can keep you full and prevent mid‑morning energy crashes. Try a Greek yogurt parfait with berries and granola, a tofu scramble with veggies, or overnight oats made with chia seeds and almond butter.</p>
<p>Smoothie bowls are another popular option. Blend a frozen banana with spinach, a scoop of protein powder and unsweetened almond milk, then top with nuts and seeds. Or, for convenience, pour a Koia shake over cereal for a quick breakfast on the go.</p>
<p>Aim for 20‑25 grams of protein at breakfast to support muscle maintenance and stable blood sugar. Combine it with fiber and healthy fats for lasting satiety.</p>
