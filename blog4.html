  <h1>Protein and Bone Health: The Connection You Should Know</h1>
  <p>Osteoporosis disproportionately affects women, especially after menopause. While calcium and vitamin D receive much of the spotlight, protein is also crucial for bone health. Collagen, the primary protein in bones, requires amino acids to maintain strength and flexibility.</p>
<p>Insufficient protein intake can lead to decreased bone mineral density, while adequate protein combined with weightâ€‘bearing exercise promotes bone formation. Choose lean protein sources and include dairy or fortified plant milks to get calcium and vitamin D alongside protein.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about your bone health and consider adding resistance training to your routine. A balanced diet with enough protein, calcium and vitamin D can help you maintain strong bones for decades.</p>
