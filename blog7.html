  <h1>The Protein & GLP‑1 Connection: What Women Should Know</h1>
  <p>GLP‑1 medications are not just for men. Women also use Ozempic and similar drugs to manage weight. However, researchers warn that these medications can lead to muscle loss if not paired with strength training and sufficient protein【174947726990039†L27-L110】.</p>
<p>Women already have lower baseline muscle mass than men, so preserving it is especially important. Aim for 1‑1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and incorporate resistance exercises two to three times a week.</p>
<p>If you experience reduced appetite on GLP‑1, nutrient‑dense liquids like Koia can help you meet protein goals without overfilling your stomach. Combine them with other foods to ensure you get fiber and healthy fats.</p>
