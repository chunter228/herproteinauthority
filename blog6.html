  <h1>Balancing Macros for Women’s Fitness Goals</h1>
  <p>Macros—protein, carbohydrates and fats—work together to fuel your body. While protein builds and repairs tissues, carbohydrates provide energy and fats support hormone production. Women’s macro needs vary based on activity level, goals and life stage.</p>
<p>A common starting point is allocating 30% of calories to protein, 40% to carbohydrates and 30% to fats, then adjusting based on how you feel and perform. Experiment with macro ratios to find what works best for you, and consider working with a dietitian for personalized guidance.</p>
<p>Remember, quality matters just as much as quantity. Choose whole‑grain carbs, healthy fats like avocado and olive oil, and lean protein sources such as fish, legumes and Koia shakes.</p>
