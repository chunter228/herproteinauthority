  <h1>Strength Training and Protein: A Woman's Guide</h1>
  <p>Strength training isn’t just for bodybuilders—it’s essential for women’s health. Lifting weights preserves bone density, boosts metabolism and shapes a toned physique. To support muscle recovery, aim for 20‑30 grams of protein after workouts and spread intake throughout the day.</p>
<p>Many women worry about ‘bulking up,’ but this is a myth. Building significant muscle requires intensive training and high calorie intakes. Adequate protein ensures you develop lean, defined muscles without excess bulk.</p>
<p>Choose protein sources that align with your preferences and values: chicken, fish, beans, tofu and shakes like Koia can all fit. Pair protein with carbohydrates post‑workout to replenish glycogen and help muscles repair.</p>
