  <h1>Protein Myths: Why You Won’t Get Bulky</h1>
  <p>Many women hesitate to increase protein for fear of ‘bulking up.’ In reality, building large muscles requires a combination of high calorie intake, heavy weights and specific genetics. Consuming adequate protein simply ensures your muscles repair and grow enough to support strength and tone.</p>
<p>Protein helps preserve lean tissue during weight loss, which keeps your metabolism humming. Without sufficient protein, the body may break down muscle for energy. Experts recommend spreading protein throughout the day and pairing it with activity to achieve a toned, athletic look.</p>
<p>Enjoy protein from a variety of sources—salmon, chickpeas, eggs, dairy or a Koia shake—and don’t let unfounded myths hold you back from fueling your body properly.</p>
