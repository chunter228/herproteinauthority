  <h1>Best Plant‑Based Proteins for Women</h1>
  <p>Whether you’re vegetarian or simply looking to diversify your diet, plant‑based proteins offer powerful benefits. Beans, lentils, edamame and tofu are not only protein‑rich but also provide fiber and phytonutrients that support heart health. Research shows that higher plant‑to‑animal protein ratios are associated with reduced cardiovascular risk【595822928387425†L91-L147】.</p>
<p>For quick options, consider plant‑based shakes like Koia. These blends combine multiple plant proteins (pea, rice, chickpea) to provide a complete amino acid profile. They’re convenient for busy days and gentle on digestion.</p>
<p>Remember to rotate your protein sources. Variety ensures you obtain different amino acids and minerals, and it keeps meals interesting.</p>
